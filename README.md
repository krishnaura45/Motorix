# Motorix : DC Motor Controller

### INTRODUCTION
A direct current (DC) motor is the oldest type of electrical motor that has gained widespread use in a variety of electronic devices and equipment. DC motors have different arrangements and operation peculiarities. The common feature and the essential condition of all DC motors is the generation of a variable magnetic field that provides their non-stop operation. A DC motor has some significant advantages, and one of them is the simplicity of its control system. 

The intended use of a motor controller is to manage the performance of an electrical motor. Irrespective of the motor type, this electronic device can fulfil the following functions:
 - start/stop the motor;
 - change the rotation direction;
 - control the speed and torque;
 - provide overload protection;
 - prevent electrical faults.

This circuit is designed to run a motor from the same power source as a microcontroller. Setting I/O pin 1 high makes the motor spin in one direction, and setting pin 2 high makes it spin in the other. Setting both pins low stops the motor, so speed control can be achieved through a PWM signal to a pin. Setting both pins high at the same time shorts your battery, and should be avoided. 

### EXPERIMENTAL PROTOTYPE (WORKING)
<b> Activating Motor Spin (Pin 1 High):</b>
- When pin one is set high by the microcontroller, NPN transistor Q7 turns on.
- This action grounds the base of PNP transistor Q5, switching it on as well.
- Q5 then connects the +12 volts to MOSFETs Q1 and Q4, linking the motor to positive and ground, causing it to spin.

<b>Changing Motor Direction (Pin 2 High):</b>
- Setting pin 2 high reverses the motor's polarity, connecting it to positive and ground in the opposite direction.

<b>Protection Against Voltage Surges:</b>
Four diodes safeguard the transistors from voltage spikes that may occur when abruptly stopping the DC motor.

<b>Base Pulling and Current Limitation:</b>
- 10K ohm resistors pull the transistor bases to ground when the I/O pin goes low, ensuring proper switching behavior.
- 2200 ohm resistors limit the current drawn from the I/O pins to safeguard them from damage.
